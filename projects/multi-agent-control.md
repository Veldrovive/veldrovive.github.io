Intelligence by itself can only get an agent so far. The reason humanity has achieved so much is not solely due to our intelligence, but also due to our ability to cooperate and coordinate with one another. Similarly, a single robot that can act in a "rational" manor is simply not enough to accomplish complex tasks. In this project, I attempt to build a system that allows for robust control of a single robot to execute a simple task and then utilize a dependency graph of tasks and a solver for the multi traveling salesman problem to coordinate multiple robots to execute these complex tasks in parallel.
