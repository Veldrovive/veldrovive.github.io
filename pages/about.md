# About Me

I am an engineering science student at the University of Toronto, where I am studying robotics engineering. My passion lies in control systems and coordination of robots to perform complex tasks. I have been programming since a young age, starting with Scratch and later progressing to JavaScript for writing plugins for Minecraft servers.

In industry, I have mostly worked as a web developer, however, in school clubs and personal projects, my focus is on vision, sensing, path planning and control. I had the opportunity to be part of the UofT self-driving car team, Autoronto, and also spent a year as the vision lead on the UofT aerospace team's autonomous flying vehicle division. Recently, I have been working on the LAION project, replicating OpenAI's DALLE2, as well as a project using a CLIP model to match brain scans to images people were seeing at the time of the scans.
